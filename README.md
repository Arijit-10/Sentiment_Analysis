Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis, also known as **opinion mining**, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. This project provides a solution for analyzing the sentiment of textual data.

## About The Project

This project aims to implement a robust sentiment analysis system. It can be used to process text data from various sources (e.g., social media, product reviews, news articles) and classify the sentiment expressed within them. The core idea is to leverage machine learning or deep learning models to understand and categorize human emotions and opinions from text.

-----

## Features

  * **Text Preprocessing**: Includes steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and lowercasing to clean and prepare text data for analysis.
  * **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies text into predefined sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
  * **Model Implementation**: (Specify the models you used, e.g., "Utilizes machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines," or "Employs deep learning architectures like LSTMs or Transformers.")
  * **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides metrics to assess model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
  * **Visualization**: (If applicable, describe any visualizations, e.g., "Generates visualizations of sentiment distribution and model performance.")

-----

## Technologies Used

  * **Python**
  * **Jupyter Notebook** (or other IDE/environment you used)
  * **Libraries**:
      * `pandas` (for data manipulation)
      * `numpy` (for numerical operations)
      * `scikit-learn` (for machine learning models and utilities)
      * `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit for text processing)
      * `matplotlib` (for plotting)
      * `seaborn` (for statistical data visualization)
      * (Add any other specific libraries like `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, `transformers`, `textblob`, `vaderSentiment`, etc., that you used.)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x
  * `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arijit-10/Sentiment_Analysis.git
    cd Sentiment_Analysis
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you might list the main libraries to install, e.g., `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn`)
4.  **Download NLTK data (if using NLTK):**
    Open a Python interpreter or a Jupyter Notebook and run:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('vader_lexicon') # If you use VADER
    ```

## Usage

(Provide clear instructions on how to use your project. This section will be highly dependent on your specific implementation.)

For example, if your project involves a Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Open and run the `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Sentiment_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb`) to see the analysis and results.

Or, if it's a Python script:

1.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    (Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your primary script)
