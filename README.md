# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis, also known as **opinion mining**, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project provides a robust solution for analyzing and classifying the sentiment of textual data, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

## üöÄ Features

  * **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes efficient methods for cleaning and preparing raw text data, such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and lowercasing.
  * **Sentiment Classification Models**: Leverages powerful machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) to accurately classify text sentiment.
  * **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
  * **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates insightful visualizations showcasing sentiment distribution and model performance over different datasets.
  * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle various scales of text data, from small datasets to larger corpora.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **Python** (3.8+)
  * **Jupyter Notebook** (for development and exploration)
  * **Key Libraries**:
      * `pandas`: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
      * `numpy`: For fundamental numerical operations.
      * `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models, pre-processing, and evaluation utilities.
      * `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit for advanced text processing (tokenization, stopwords).

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** and `pip` (Python package installer) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arijit-10/Sentiment_Analysis.git
    cd Sentiment_Analysis
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download NLTK data (if using NLTK features):**
    Open a Python interpreter or a Jupyter Notebook and execute:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    # If using VADER sentiment analysis
    nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

This project primarily uses a Jupyter Notebook for demonstration and analysis.

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the cloned `Sentiment_Analysis` directory and open the main notebook file (e.g., `Sentiment_Analysis_Model.ipynb`).
3.  Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and view results.
